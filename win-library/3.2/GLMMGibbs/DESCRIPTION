Title: Generalised Linear Mixed Models by Gibbs Sampling
Description: Generalised Linear Mixed Models are an extension of
             Generalised Linear Models to include non-independent responses.
             This package allows them to be fitted by including functions
             for declaring factors to be random effects, for fitting models
             and generic functions for examining the fits.
