project191.R contains all code used for this project that was pertinent to the final product. This does not include any code to create tables or plots. It contains three functions:

project191R():
This is a rundown of the specs of this project. It is not intended to be run, however, as obtaining the distance correlation matrix requires a tremendous amount of computation time.

sortCor():
Helper function to sort the correlations to properly rank the instruments, as well as compiling it into a formula that satisfies the lm() function.

limRegression():
Computes the linear regression using the appropriate function and datasets.
